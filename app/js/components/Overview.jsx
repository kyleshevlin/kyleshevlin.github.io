    <p>
      I am passionate about JavaScript. Especially React, Redux, and functional programming. I share this passion by teaching on Twitch stream every week, by speaking at meetups and conferences, and by being a general source of encouragement on Twitter. Seriously, I mean that. There's enough shit talkers out there. I don't intend to be one of them.

      I also share my passion through my podcast, <a href="https://secondcareerdevs.com">Second Career Devs</a>. This is my second career, and I am so grateful that it has worked out well for me. I felt compelled to find others like me and share their stories. I believe you get a lot of value when you hire career changers and it's well worth listening to their insights.

      I am looking for opportunities to use my passion every day. I want the opportunity to work on big projects, contribute to open source, and to make meaningful decisions.
